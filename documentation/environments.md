# Environments

At present, there is only a single production environment available to Partners to integrate with Latch services. The production environment will include authentication and device services. Therefore Partners must exercise best practices when developing and testing applications and services to ensure reasonably acceptable levels of traffic to the Latch BE. 

Latch will provide the Partners with a specific set of devices that can be operated within the production environment and can be used during app development and SDK implementation.

Traffic from Partner BE will be aggressively monitored for unusual activity and rate-limited based on reasonable usage patterns. 

In the future, a sandbox environment will be developed by Latch and provided to Partners that will mimic much of the production environment.
