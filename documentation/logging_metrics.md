# Logging, Metrics, and Diagnostics

It is expected that Partners will invest a great deal of time to develop accurate and detailed solutions to log interactions with each component, the SDK, Partner App, Partner BE, and Latch BE. 

Partners must provide a reasonably detailed chain of diagnostic logging and telemetry data to Latch support and engineering teams to properly diagnose and resolve issues promptly for Latch and the Partnerâ€™s mutual end-users.
