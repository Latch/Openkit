# Release Schedule

Latch teams will work to ensure that issues are resolved in a timely manner by providing hotfixes for Security and Sev1 issues that are either identified by internal Latch teams or by Partner teams.

New documentation and updates to existing documentation will take place on Wednesdays. Latch will provide new legal, security, product, and engineering documentation to you along with explanations for changes as we continue to evolve the SDK and API.

During the Beta phases of the Latch SDK program, Partners can expect a new release every two weeks that will comprise new features, and bug fixes, in addition to performance and security enhancements.  

After the beta schedule, Latch will increase the schedule to monthly release cycles allowing Partners time to update their apps.

> Partners will be expected to update their Appâ€™s Latch SDK version within 90 days of release.
